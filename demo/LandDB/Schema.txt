Each table has a primary key column, comprised of meaningless identifiers.

The non primary key numeric columns are always not null and are foreign keys.

The string-valued columns in the Animal file are meaningful data.

The data is denormalized: the path Amphibian -> Animal duplicates the path 
  Amphibian -> LandAnimal -> Animal.
